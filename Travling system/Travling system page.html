                An Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Welcome! This is a guide to use the Traveling Event System. This system was designed not with the
                goal
                of
                achieving
                realism when roleplaying extended travel, but with the goal of making it exciting. It’s meant to
                recreate
                the feel and
                appeal of other media centered on travel, focusing on dramatic scenarios rather than the real-life
                mechanics
                of travel.
                The Traveling Event System has also been made for those who find things like tracking specific
                distance
                depending on
                pace and other minutiae of other traveling systems in the game tedious. Its design concentrates on
                keeping
                those simple
                and to a minimum.
                It is, therefore, not your best option if you’re looking to recreate a realistic travel experience.
                This
                guide will not
                go over how rationing food works or how much ground the party covers when traveling, but rather will
                give
                you a way to
                account for that while prioritizing excitement at the table and a story-first travel design.
                You are welcome to add more specifics like food rationing or distance covered, but this guide does
                not
                seek
                to do that,
                nor has the Travel Event System been designed with that in mind

        <div class="distance">
            <h2 class="title">
                Distance
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Travel Event System (TES for short) measures distance traveled by <span>Events</span>.
                The longer the distance,
                the more Events
                the party “bumps into”.
                <span>Distances</span> are measured in three brackets.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Close</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Far</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Very far</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We are deliberately not including example distances in these. Close could be 6 miles (10 kilometers)
                or
                18
                miles (30
                kilometers). It is for the Game Master to decide how much time to spend on each “leg” of the
                journey.
                Once
                you have
                roughly estimated the distances in your map, you will know exactly how many events the party will
                run
                into
                on their
                travels.

            <p>
                Events are the main component of the Traveling Event System.
                An event is anything that happens while traveling, and the
                GM decides what events occur. How many events happen while
                on your journey to somewhere depends on the distance you are
                traveling.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Close</span> : 1 Event
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Far</span> : 2 Events
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Very far</span> : 3 Events
                </li>
            </ul>
            Once a party has encountered the number of events
            determined by the distance traveled, they arrive at
            their destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>TIP</span>: It is important to note that you are welcome and
                encouraged to alter these numbers.As a matter of fact, the systemitself encourages it.
                If you feel like the distance they are traveling is long enough to merit 4 events
                because you want it to feel longer, you are more than welcome to tweak it to be so. Also,
                nothing is stopping you from adding another event to a short
                distance if the needs of the story dictate it. Plenty of events can happen on a short walk!
                Rather than getting tangled up in specifics about distance, ask yourself what this journey will feel
                like.
                These numbers are just a guide.

                Once you know the number of events,
                you are ready to choose the events themselves.
                Events are divided into three main
                categories, and are each assigned a
                color that you can place down on your
                map for quick reference.

                Red - Combat Events:
            </h2>
            <p>
                These events are combat scenarios. Because you deliberately placed a
                combat event, these can be story-relevant combat
                encounters that happen while traveling, which systems that rely on
                random tables don’t account for. Combat events can be
                an opportunity to showcase the monstrous flora and fauna of your world,
                or a great way to pick up the pace after a long
                section of roleplaying.

                    The party has finally caught the attention of the main antagonist,
                    and they’ve come to meet them in the field themselves
                    to ascertain how much of a threat the party would be by
                    challenging them to a “friendly” duel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The party meets with their rivals after the party
                    swindled them out of their money a couple of sessions back, and a
                    fight breaks out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A spy for the main villain has located the party’s whereabouts.
                    If the party doesn’t want this information to go
                    directly to the person they are fighting against,
                    the spy must be dispatched by any means necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The party has been noticing what look
                    like intricate markings on the trees.
                    Little do they know these are the tell-tale
                    signs of a monster that marks their territory
                    with these signs to warn trespassers,
                    and the party did not listen to
                    these warnings.

                These events are roleplay scenarios. They could range from
                a chance to meet a new helpful NPC to a tense negotiation
                with a hostile one. Roleplay events can be as high-stakes
                as combat events, and because they do not need to be balanced
                in the same way as combat needs to be, the stakes can be
                much higher for the party. Roleplay events are also the perfect
                way to showcase something that is often ignored when
                worldbuilding; just as worldbuilding involves coming up with
                geography, fauna, and flora, it also involves coming up with
                different cultures and their mores. A roleplay encounter
                could go south because of culture-specific etiquette
                rules that the party fails to follow. god don’t i know it

            <h4 class="examples">Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The party meets a fellow traveling band of adventurers
                    with a very similar goal to theirs. A rivalry naturally emerges
                    between the two groups that will continue throughout the campaign.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The party runs into a procession of knights defending a gilded carriage.
                    A very powerful noble is traveling from one
                    city to the next, and invites the party inside their carriage for tea and
                    to make them an offer they simply cannot
                    refuse.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It appears that the party has walked right into an area where
                    the ghosts of the deceased cannot move on. Some sort of
                    evil magic traps all those who pass through this place, and
                    if the party cannot figure out a way out, they’ll suffer the
                    same fate as the spirits cursed to remain anchored to this
                    land forever. How will they convince the ghosts to help them?
                </li>
                <li>
                    A traveling merchant seems to be making their way towards
                    the party. As the party takes a look at the merchant’s wares,
                    they cannot shake the feeling something is off about them.
                    All their prices are extremely low, but every time they ask
                    for something, the merchant offhandedly mentions that it
                    will cost “some gold and a favor”.

                Yellow - Exploration Events:
            </h2>
            <p>
                These events are an exploration scenario. There is no better
                event to show off the world than exploration events, as
                they shift the focus away from people and monsters and towards
                the land itself. They are an opportunity to make the
                fantastical locales your party travels to into tangible things
                that the party can interact with and must figure out a
                way to traverse and conquer. Exploration events offer a great
                alternative to combat and roleplay encounters, as they
                shift the focus from characters that can solve problems with
                their might or their wiles and towards characters who rely
                on other skills like Survival, Stealth -- or even more obscure
                picks like Animal Handling and Vehicle Proficiencies --
                to take the spotlight. It’s also a fantastic way to introduce
                the concept of Skill Challenges into your games.

                    magic seems to be wearing thinner and thinner with time,
                    and random jets of water shoot from either of the two walls of
                    water. What’s worse, monsters have taken to using these
                    jets of water to attack those who pass through the strait. How

                    trembles as the gargantuan beast stirs. The party must make

                Sometimes, an event belongs in two or even three of the

                a Combo Event. Combo Events are events that mix several
                categories together, either because they could turn from one
                into the other, or because they exhibit traits of both at
                the same time. You can use these to add a wider diversity to
                your events when traveling.
